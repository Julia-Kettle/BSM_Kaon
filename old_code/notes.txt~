loop through kinematics, scheme, basis
  read bootstraps
  read Jamies data
  compute the pion amplitude
  read remaining data
  renormalise
  globalfit



global fit needs to happen simult for both lattices



Incorporating the new physical pnt data. Do I need the bootstraps? 
They are used in the global fit, so yes I do. 
Need to print them out from the fitting process?
