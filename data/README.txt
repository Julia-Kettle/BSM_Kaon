Z factors from 
/home/nico/work/NPR_KKbar_clean/IW/for_Jamie/old_qslash/

projection obtained from 
/home/nico/work/Project_NPR_IW_clean/24cubed_redothemall_newproj/data_24cubed_100boot
/home/nico/work/Project_NPR_IW_clean/32cubed_new_newproj/data_32cubed_100boot/


---------------------------------------------------
I am cheating for the Z factors !

the new ones are the _100 only gg and qq
I did not redo the computation for 500 boot, 
I just neglect the error 

for the E case, I am reading the old value and don't neglect the error

I put a hack in the renormalisation_BSM script !

----------------
now I am nony cheating fot the E ones

I use the old qslash, the diff is negligible
